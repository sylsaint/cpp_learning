1. represent concepts as classes
2. separate the interface of a class from its implementation
3. use public data(struct) only when it really is just data
4. define a constructor to initializing objects
5. by default define single-argument constructor explicit
6. define a member function of objects const if it doesn't modify the state of objects
7. a concrete class is the simplest form of class.
8. make function a member only if it needs direct access to representation of a class
9. use a namespace to make association between a class and its helper function explicit
10. make a function which need not be called on specific object static
